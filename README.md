JMeter-jPOS-components
======================

Adds a jPOS sampler to JMeter to communicate with banking services

Installation of JMeter plugin is simple, the plugin is build separate from the actual JMeter code.
# Building JMeter Plugin
`git clone https://github.com/erlanggaelfallujah/JMeter-jPOS-components.git`

`cd ~/JMeter-jPOS-components`

`mvn dependency:copy-dependencies install -DexcludeGroupIds=org.apache.jmeter`

Note: the '-DexcludeGroupIds=org.apache.jmeter' parameter tells maven not to copy the jmeter jars into the target dependencies directory. This is necessary if you run a different version of jmeter than what this plugin compiles against as when you copy over the JMeter-jPOS-components jars (see below) you will end up with different versions of the ApacheJMeter jar in jmeter's lib directory, which really confuses the app when it tries to run. 

# Download latest JMeter and unzip
From http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
Untar /unzip to a ~/jmeter

# Copy the artifacts into the JMeter lib and lib/ext Directoryâ€™s.
`cd ~/jmeter`

`cp -Rf  ~/JMeter-jPOS-components/target/jmeter-jpos-components-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar lib/ext/`

`cp -Rf ~/JMeter-jPOS-components/target/dependency/* lib/`

You are all set, You can start the JMeter UI by running 
`cd ~/jmeter; bin/jmeter`

On the plugin jpos sampler ...

Packager field defines your iso packager in the program, usually using xml type. You can look this example at https://www.dropbox.com/s/oww38tt8e9xf39s/iso87binary.xml?dl=0

copy the CONTENT of q2 log request to the text area, for example:

`<header>32434123</header>`

`<field id="0" value="0810"/>`

`<field id="42" value="300004000050046"/>`

`<field id="46" value="5F040B3030303030303030303031DF90080B3030303030303030303032" type="binary"/>`

DO NOT FORGET TO KEEP BREAK LINE per `< />` just as your q2.log

Or you can open the test-jmeter-jpos.jmx (included)
